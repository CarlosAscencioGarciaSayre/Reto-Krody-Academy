                        <p class="sub_t_0">About Whimsical</p>
                        <p class="txt_n_0">
                            Whimsical was founded in 2017 by Kaspars Dancis and Steve Schoeffel to help teams be more
                            effective in the distributed and fully digital work environment.
                            Whimsical's product is expressive, fast, and delightful. We believe that software should
                            spark joy, not dread.
                            We are a remote-first company and big proponents of remote work because it democratizes the
                            opportunities for people everywhere.
                            Our operating philosophy is based on set of core principles, such as:
                            Sustainability: We don't believe in growth at all costs. Growth is a fundamental part of a
                            healthy existence but we want it to be in balance with sustainability and bounded by ethical
                            behavior. We strive to work calm, 40-hour work weeks. Whimsical is also committed to doing
                            our part towards a sustainable future for the planet.
                            Craftsmanship: We care deeply about our work. We are specialists, eager learners, and
                            persistent in our pursuit of quality work. We're patient and committed because building
                            great things takes time.
                            Long-term focus: We're building Whimsical for the long-haul, not a quick exit. We avoid
                            shortcuts and consider every key decision from a 10+ year perspective.
                            Partnership Mindset: We‚Äôve built the company around the idea that everybody who joins us
                            should feel like they are partners in the business. Time is precious and we want Whimsical
                            to be the place where people invest their time rather than sell it. Our equity offers are
                            100% transparent and above market average. We also pay everyone at the same level the same
                            salary, no matter where they live.
                            Please mention the word SWIFTNESS when applying to show you read the job post completely
                            (#RMjA5LjQ1LjU4LjE2MQ==). This is a feature to avoid fake spam applicants. Companies can
                            search these words to find applicants that read this and instantly see they're human.

                            When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER
                            have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for
                            trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to
                            pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also
                            always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
                            imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the
                            actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! Read
                            more to avoid scams. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote
                            OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK
                            accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information
